_I read a lot on the internet. Via RSS, preferably. Some things are memorable,
some not. I'm testing out using a link blog to highlight the best of what I
read. Maybe for others to find, maybe just for me to back to. Time will tell._

#### â†¬ [.NET on Linux: What a Contrast][dotnet_on_linux] 

I used to develop .NET professionally, and I _really_ wanted to be able to use
linux to develop instead of Windows. Back in those days, you _could_ do it, but
it was such a pain that it never felt worth it. These days I've been interested
in giving F# a try (as a maybe more friendly intro to typed functional
programming than OCaml), and if the tooling has gotten this much better maybe
it's worth giving it a shot. 

#### â†¬ [17 Life-Learnings from 17 Years of The Marginalian][marginalian] 

Somehow I've never read the Marginalian. I recognized the name when I stumbled
across this post; Maria Popova wrote the foreward for _[Dear Data][dear_data]_,
a lovely book showcasing the intersection between data and creativity. There's
a lot here, in this post and the site on the whole. I'm a little sad I only now
found out about this, but excited that there's such a backlog of articles to
dig through.

#### â†¬ [nektos/act: Run your GitHub Actions locally ðŸš€][nektos_act] 

So the README lists two reasons for using something like this. A good tool to
have in your back pocket when needed.
* ðŸ˜„ Fast feedback developing/testing/debugging github actions locally. I
  haven't run into a need for this, yet. But this would certainly beat the
  workflow of commit/push/wait/read the error/try again.
* ðŸ¤¢ Local task runner. I don't want to replace `make` or `rake` or whatever
  with something that spins up a docker image to run a linter or something. I
  can see the appeal, but it's not how I want to run things like that.

#### â†¬ [Illustrations][tom_chalky_illustrations] 

These are neat packs of vintage illustrations, ranging from florals to the
occult. I really want to find a place to use these, they're super neat.

#### â†¬ [Pika - Start Your Happy Blog][pika_blog] 

This looks like a super cool way to spin up a blog! I'm very happy with my
jekyll blog, but if I didn't like to tinker so much I would definitely use
this. I'm a fan of [Good Enough][good_enough] and their ethos, and this is
another super cool product they've come up with.
