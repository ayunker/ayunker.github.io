title: my open tabs

I came across this [blog post][open-tabs] by Anh[^knowing] reflecting on their
open tabs in their browser, and I thought it was really neat. It made me think
about my own tab usage, and got a little scared. I'm normally pretty good at
keeping open tabs to a minimum, but I've really let things go of late. 

As I've gone through them all, I've realized this has just become yet another
todo list of things I want to do and/or read. But anyways, let's get into it.

## Window 1[^windows]

* Work gMail 
* [MIT Technology Review - Toolkits for the Mind][toolkits-mind]
* [Impala - TUI for managing wifi on Linux][impala] - as I get deeper into
configuring my linux setup, this looked like a useful tool for dealing with
wifi (`iwctl` is rough).
* An interesting [article on testing performance][testing-performance] that I
haven't managed to read yet. It's a competing ruby consultancy's blog, but they
put out good articles.
* [How to Decrease Heroku Slug Size: WKHTMLTOPDF Edition][heroku-slug]
& [wkhtmltopdf-heroku][wkhtmltopdf-heroku] - something I want to try out on a
client's app, but haven't gotten around to yet.
* [Linear][linear] project board 4 client work. 
* [Glide Browser][glide-browser] - an extensible and keyboard-focused browser
based on Firefox I want to try.
* [Commit Mono Font][commit-mono] - looks like a neat font to give a try. Could
be good for terminal work or maybe on a web page?
* [If you're remote, ramble][remote-ramble] - neat idea for micro-blogging in a
remote environment. Might be something to try at =>.
* [How I Use Obsidian][obsidian-vault] - I don't use Obsidian (Bear FTW), but
neat to see how the Obsidian CEO uses it. Again, I've skimmed it but it
deserves a deeper read.
* [How we used pg_query to rewrite queries to fix bad query plans][pg-query]
another neat post, I want to give this a try on a gnarly query in one of my
projects (gotta come across one first, though).
* [The Programmer Identity Crisis][identity-crisis] - another article to read,
and holy hell the design on this website is sick.
* I haven't read this yet about [deleting your migrations][delete-migrations] -
and not sure if I'll agree with it - but want to chew it over and see what I
think.
* [Earl Grey][earl-grey] - not sure if this color scheme is really for me, but
I like the website. Like the color scheme, it's cosy.
* [How I Computer in 2024][computer-2024] - kind of an over the top setup but I
come back to this article every now and then because it's a very
opinionated/curated setup, and I'm in to that. Want to try out NextDNS as a
result of this read through.
* Local instance of client web app.
* [Robin Rendle][robin-rendle] - robin's just done (another) site redesign, and
the book spines are super cool. His site is a constant inspiration to tinker
with my own. Also, his latest post linked to Anh's site and is how I found
Anh's post that inspired me to write this one[^mind].
* [My Open Tabs][open-tabs] - the aforementioned inspiration for this post.
* Local instance of a sample rails app for a potential upcoming => blog post.
* [Cormac McCarthy's Library][mccarthy-library] - I don't know much about
McCarthy, but this is impressive. I don't remember how I stumbled across this
one.

## Window Deux

* [wmenu][wmenu] - a waylandy menu for sway I want to try out.
* [casperstorm dotfiles][casperstorm-dotfiles] - neat and minimal setup. Might
want to borrow some things here. Found this via [halloy][halloy] which looks
like a neat IRC app and very neat native UI in rust (he's the lead dev on the
project).

## Window 3 - Private Session

* Another local instance of client web app, opened in a private session to
allow me to login as a different user.

## Window 4 - Minimised

* [Peter Naur's Programming as Theory Building][theory-building] - in the
_deep_ backlog, but I really do want to read this.

Fuck, that's too many tabs. I should close some of them and get out more.

[^knowing]: it feels weird to refer to them by their first name - I've never
    met them, I've just read their blog. Though, you could argue reading a blog
    as personal and unique as this constitutes in some way, knowing them?

[^windows]: yes, plural. there are a few.

[^mind]: maybe this look into my browser tabs is actually a study of how my 
    brain works?! This is like the breadcrumbs of my mind.
