I enjoy reading monthly updates from [people][arne] [I][macwright]
[follow][duarte] (via RSS), they're always so interesting. So I figured I'd try
writing my own. It'll be good to 1) get me into a regular writing cadence (I
want to write more, here and elsewhere, this year), and 2) maybe someone will
find mine interesting (jk I don't think people read this blog). Anyways, let's
give it a try!

## general

It's been a **cold, cold** start to the year. I'm writing this in the midst of
a polar vortex, the past couple of mornings have been sub-zero before wind
chill. Brr 🥶. We've got a trip to London coming up, which will be great for a
variety of reasons, but one of which is warmer weather (I'll take 30-40s at
this point!).

## using

I picked up a [Uni Jetstream Lite Touch][jet] at the end of last year and have
been really impressed with it. I like the original Jetstreams, but sometimes
the line they put down didn't feel dark enough. The Jetstream Lite Touch is
significantly darker, while being just as smooth. It's a considerable upgrade
to an already great ink.

## reading

Decent start to year w.r.t reading. I finished *Dinner at the Night Library* by
Hika Hirada, and *The Ferryman and his Wife* by Frode Grytten. Both were ok -
they were short - which isn't a bad thing - but both felt a little scattered
and maybe trying to do too much within their page counts? Some of the ideas
felt crammed in there, not fully fleshed out.


I'm continuing my goal from last year to read more internationally. Last year I
read exactly 50% of my books from international (i.e. not American or
English/Scottish/Irish) authors. It was a nice challenge[^1]! It did get me off
to a good start reading widely though - the year starts off with a notch for
Japan and another for Norway. I've read a lot of Japanese lit recently, but
*Ferryman* was my first Norwegian novel since 2020!

## watching

We've been working our way through some cozy mysteries that have some new
episodes - *Shakespeare & Hathaway* is fast becoming a top favorite, *Shetland*
(though not quite so cozy), and a new series *Bookish*.

We're working our way through the Taskmaster backlog now that it's on
[youtube][tm_yt] - we're through Series 3, 4, 5, and working on 6. For the most
part it's getting better and better every series. Neat to kind of see it evolve
into what it is now.

[This][wiki] is a really interesting talk around AI generated content in
Wikipedia. It's a bleak world out there, but it's heartening to see such
dedicated people working with Wikimedia.


## listening

This month has been a lot of the same as before - lots of Dry Cleaning and of
course Godspeed You! Black Emperor.

Dry Cleaning put out *Secret Love* this month, but I haven't given it enough of
a listen yet. I'm still stuck on *New Long Leg*, it's so good.

And I can't stop listening to Godspeed, it's just too good. I've spent a lot of
time going through recordings on the [internet archive][gybe_ia], and am
particularly fascinated by their 2+ hour long sets around the time of *Yanqui
U.X.O.* Also been watching this (semi-?) pro recording of a [2.45 hour long set
in France][gybe_yt], in the same era. 40 minute long motherfucker=redeemer, and
East Hastings is particularly intense.

Our Side has to Win, the final track on *G_d’s Pee AT STATE’S END!* is so
hauntingly beautiful. It's also led me into A Winged Victory for the Sullen,
which also create beautiful ambient/drone-y sounds.

I guess that's it for now, let's see if I can keep this up all year long!

[^1]: Not challenge, that sounds not quite right. More like conscious effort? I
    really should write a blog post about this sometime soon.
