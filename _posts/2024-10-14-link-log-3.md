<span class="grey-text interjection-text">
_I read a lot on the internet. Via RSS, preferably. Some things are memorable,
some not. I'm testing out using a link blog to highlight the best of what I
read. Maybe for others to find, maybe just for me to back to. Time will tell._
</span>

This one's been a long time in the making, but has some _really_ good articles.

#### ↬ [Data exploration using VIM][data_exploration_using_vim] 

Michael explains a cool way to interactively explore large text files (think
logs) in vim, but using the existing cli tools you know and love. The things I
found particularly cool is `cat`ing a file to a new buffer rather than using
the existing file so you can easily write your changes to a new file, and
getting to use vim's undo commands to easily revert when the inevitable typo or
wrong command argument shows up.

#### ↬ [All Hail The Cloud][all_hail_the_cloud] 

Good lord this was a good read. Depressing, but good. Via [Dense
Discovery][dd].

#### ↬ [Invest in Interfaces][interfaces] 

I definitely agree with Luke's arguments here. Investing in your
interfaces/tools pays dividends over time, and well worth the monetary or time
investment. And of course there's a fine line between investing in tools and
justifying spending (wasting) money on something you don't need.

#### ↬ [Guided by Vices][guided_by_vices] 

This perfectly describes how I feel about social media. I've kind of had these
ideas bouncing around in my head for a bit, but never been able to fully flesh
them out. If I ever need to explain it, I'll just point people to this article.
