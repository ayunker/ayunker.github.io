I keep paper notebooks at work. So much of my output is captured digitally - be
it code, updates in tickets, slack, email. But a lot of my thinking happens on
paper. It's much easier to sketch things out, think through a problem - it
helps me think. Anyways, here are the notebooks I've used at work for the past
5+ years. I don't often refer back to them, but I like having them near me.

This is the first notebook I used when I started seriously noting at work. It
was a good notebook, good paper, but a little bit too small (I think it's B6
slim size?). I used this while at Corptax and Machinery Pete.

I liked this notebook a lot, but don't remember where I got it from. Maybe
Topdrawer? Nice size, nice paper though. Used while working at Machinery Pete.

Then I found these [Kokuyo Campus notebooks][kokuyo-notebook]. A5 size, only 50
sheets so not too bulky and lays flat easily. I bought a couple, then they were
out of stock when I went to buy some more. I was dismayed. Now I buy a few at a
time so I always have a couple at hand. When it's time for a new one, I grab
one out of the cabinet, slap some stickers on it, and it's ready to go.

I took a brief detour with this [Letterfolk Composition
Notebook][letterfolk-comp-book]. I used to use a ton of composition notebooks
when I was in college, you could get them for like a dollar at the bookstore.
Great for scratching out math homework, but terrible quality paper. This one
has better quality paper, but it was just a bit too big. I was hooked on the
Kokuyo notebooks, and nothing else could compare.

Back to the Kokuyo Campus, and I see myself sticking with these for a long long
time. Another great thing about this size - I print out monthly calendars so I
can [draw my calendar][drawing-the-calendar], and they fit inside the cover
perfectly when folded in half.
