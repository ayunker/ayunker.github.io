_I read a lot on the internet. Via RSS, preferably. Some things are memorable,
some not. I'm testing out using a link blog to highlight the best of what I
read. Maybe for others to find, maybe just for me to back to. Time will tell._

#### ↬ [DHH's rails world keynote][dhh_keynote] 

DHH is super polarizing, and I don't often agree with him. But this keynote
really made me excited to write Rails.

#### ↬ [git absorb][git_absorb] 

The thing that always holds me back from using fixups is that I need to know
the sha of the commit i wanna fixup. This solves that problem and makes fixups
a breeze.

#### ↬ [LLVM is Smarter than Me][llvm] 

I don't know much about compilers, but it was really neat to see an
optimization for sum using Gauss' Summation technique.

#### ↬ [Phone Home][phone_home] 

I spend too much time on my phone. I like this idea of keeping your phone off
your person to reduce distraction. I think the Apple Watch will make it easier
to keep the phone away but still receive "critical" notifications.
