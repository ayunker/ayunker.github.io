I just published my [2023 Field Notes recap][fn_recap_2023], but I saw a [post
on instagram][instagram_post] where someone did a recap on their entire Field
Notes collection. Inspired, I decided to do the same type of recap myself.

Field Notes have been in my pocket for over 10 years now (!!!), but I had no
idea how many I had actually used. Turns out it's 86! Kind of lower than I
guessed, but it's the quality, not the quantity üòÖ.

They used to all fit in one [archival box][archival_box], but since 2022 they
have overflowed and now just sit in piles held together by bands of rubber.

*If you can't take artsy photos of your pocket notebooks, what can you?*
