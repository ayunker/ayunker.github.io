title: January Bicycling Challenge

This January, I bicycled 15 miles every day _(on an exercise bike indoors)_.
For 31 days. Straight. No rest days. It was tough, but I'm glad I did it - I
wasn't sure if I'd actually be able to keep it up all month long.

The inspiration came from [Pas Normal Studio's January Resolution Challenge]
[pas_resolution] - 1,250km in the month of January. That comes out to ~776
miles, or about 25 miles a day. I was interested, but 25 miles a day was too
much for me. Kat suggested 15 miles a day instead and that seemed achievable,
but certainly still a challenge. 16 miles is what we ride on the lakefront in
warmer weather, and the challenge would be if I could keep it up day in and day
out for the whole month.

465 miles later, it turns out I could manage it. Some days felt good, some I
wasn't sure I could finish. But I did. My times ranged anywhere from 45 minutes
to just (barely!) under an hour. I went full gas on the 31st and finished
sub-45. A good way to send it off.

I'm glad I did it, but I'm glad it's over. I feel like I got stronger and I had
better rides the further we got into the month. But I'm excited to do some
non-bike workouts again...after a couple of rest days.
