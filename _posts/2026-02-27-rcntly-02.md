I enjoy reading monthly updates from [people][arne] [I][macwright]
[follow][duarte] (via RSS), they're always so interesting. So I figured I'd try
writing my own. It'll be good to 1) get me into a regular writing cadence (I
want to write more, here and elsewhere, this year), and 2) maybe someone will
find mine interesting (jk I don't think people read this blog). Anyways, let's
give this a try!

## general

The big news this month was our trip to London at the start of the month. We
spent a week exploring and eating pastries and drinking coffees, then Kat
stayed another week for work. It was an amazing trip! More will be written
elsewhere about that.

## using

We were able to hit up Muji while in London, and I stocked up on some new
stationery. I got a new retractable gel [pen], and a lil A6 [notebook]. I've
already half filled up the notebook, and it's a nice writing experience.

I'm working through all the coffee beans picked up in London. I finished Square
Mile's Red Brick (surprisingly difficult to dial in) and am working through
Origin's Pathfinder (bit better behaved and tasty).

## reading

For book club we read Agatha Christie's *The Man in the Brown Suit*. It's one
of her earlier novels and not her best, but still a fun read. Enjoyed. Also
finished *God Emperor of Dune*, which turned out to be my least favorite of the
Dune saga so far - the 3,500 year jump forward kind of lost me a bit.

I also reread [these][emacs_1] [posts][emacs_2] by the CEO/CTO of Fugue and his
emacs setup. I'm not an emacs user but I enjoy reading about using text-based
apps even when they might not be the first tool that comes to mind. I come back
to these posts every couple of years.

## watching

We finished *Shetland* and *Bookish*, both very good but very different vibes.
We're on to Series 8 of Taskmaster!

The Champions League and Europa League have reached knockout rounds, and I've
very much enjoyed keeping up with the highlights there. Also been keeping up
with 6 Nations Rugby, but I still only half understand the rules.

## listening

I've had some time to listen to Dry Cleaning's *Secret Love*, and I've grown to
really like it. *Secret Love (Concealed in a Drawing of a Boy)* is probably my
favorite track. *New Long Leg* remains my favorite album of theirs, but the gap
has narrowed significantly.
