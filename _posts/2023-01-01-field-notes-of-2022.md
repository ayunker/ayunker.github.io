title: field notes of 2022

I usually post a recap picture of all the [Field Notes][fn] that I've used over
the past year on instagram. Felt like writing a bit about them this year so
figured this would be the better medium for this.

I still use these things daily, and would feel lost without them. I just don't
think anything else comes close to capturing thoughts, feelings, ideas, todos. I
never go anywhere without one.

I think this marks the first full year without an active [Colors
subscription][colors]. I still feel slightly guilty about canceling that, like I
don't believe in Field Notes anymore, but I have so many unused notebooks, and I
still managed to buy some new ones anyway this year. I've got a runway of years
before I run out.

Anyways, here they are in all their glory:
