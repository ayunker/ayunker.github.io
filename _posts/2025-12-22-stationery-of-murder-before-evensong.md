Kat and I just finished the tv series [*Murder Before Evensong*][mb4es], based
on the novel of the same name by the Reverend Richard Coles. And boy, did it
keep this stationery nerd on the edge of his seat. Set in a rural English
village in the 80's, stationery is seen, used, and discussed throughout the
series. It's even a key point in the plot (but I'll try to keep spoilers out of
this review)!

I enjoyed writing about the stationery in [*Ludwig*][ludwig] so much, I
couldn't resist doing the same for *Murder Before Evensong*. Let's get into it!

## The Pentel P205

Let's start off with my biggest complaint with this series. When Daniel first
meets DS Vanloo, he compliments him on mechanical the pencil he is using, the
Pentel P205. Except...it's not. It is a similar pencil, but it is decidedly
**not** the [P205][] [^p205].

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/pencil-2.jpg" %}

While the P205 is historically accurate - it was first manufactured sometime in
the 1970's - the shape (especially around the knock and the grip) just doesn't
match up. I have looked up some [vintage P205s][vintage_p205] from the 70's in
case the design changed; but nope, that design hasn't changed a lick in 50
years.

%}

Upon further review, I'm fairly confident the pencil is a [Pentel Graph
500][pg505] (PG505), now known as the Pentel Graphlet. It has the black tip at
the end of the knock, the clips look similar, as does the knurling. The PG505
was released some time in the 80s (having trouble pinning down an exact year),
so it is also historically accurate. I think the money-shot would be if we
could see the lead indicator on the knurling in the series. Alas, it is never
visible. But even without that confirmation, I'm confident in its ID.

Another possibility was the [Alvin Draft/Matic][dm05] (DM05), but the knocks
don't match up as neatly. This was my first guess, but Kat's quick research led
us to the [Graphgear][pg525] (PG525) and Graphlet (PG505).

It's mildly frustrating [^frustrating] for the pencil to be named so
specifically, but for the prop to not be accurate. The P205 is still in
production and is not difficult to procure...so why was the prop wrong? When
Daniel spies Thwaite's JLC Reverso, Ned is actually wearing a
Reverso [^reverso]. The Pentel P205 is significantly easier to procure than a
Reverso (even a knockoff). But if a PG505 is what you have...you could change
the line to say that. It wouldn't be book-accurate but it would be accurate as
to what's on the screen.

There is another possibility - that Daniel identified the pen incorrectly. I
haven't read the novel, he could have misidentified the pencil and DS Vanloo
*was* using a PG505 but didn't know or feel like correcting him. In that case,
the series would have been accurate to the book. But I can't know for sure
until I get around to reading it [^book_backlog].

## The Rest of Daniel's Stationery

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-2.jpg" %}

The Canon certainly is a stationery fan, as we can see from his writing desk
throughout the series. He covers all the bases at his desk, with a fountain
pen, Parker Jotter, and what looks to be a drafting pencil. While the Jotters
were manufactured in England for a while, looks like they would have been [made
in Wisconsin][made_in_wi] during the time of the novel. Which may have made
them more exotic in England? Or by that time they might have solidified
themselves as *the* ballpoint and would have been available anywhere in the
world.

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-3.jpg" %}

The pencil on the desk looks like it also could be a Pentel Graphlet, except a
PG509 based on the color of the cap. Which makes it even more confusing that
Daniel got the P205 and PG505 mixed up ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Now the fountain pen and ink are quite interesting. The ink is Registrar's ink,
i.e. a very specific blue-black iron-gall ink. I've heard of Registrar's ink
before, but didn't know its history. Registrar's ink, because of its permanent,
waterproof properties, was used for official documents, one of which being
entering births and marriages into a church *registry*. Neat!

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/registrars-ink-2.jpg" %}

Apparently, in the 80's it also wasn't widely available to anyone (maybe as a
means of protection against forgeries). It was available to church folk,
lawyers, and the sort. And it had to be special ordered. The classic options
for Registrar's ink is England's own Diamine [Registrar's][diamine_registrars]
or ESS (Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies) [Registrar's Ink][ess_registrars].
But looking at the bottle from which Daniel fills his pen, I would guess he's
using [Parker Registrar's ink][parker_registrars], another potentially odd
choice to use the ink of a (then) US-based company rather than the I'm sure
preferred and more affordable local variety.

There are two fountain pens seen - the one on the desk and the red one Daniel
uses to write his sermons. From my research into Registrar's ink I stumbled
across the Parker Registrar's pen ([1][ess_registrars] and
[2][parker_registrars_pen]). This is likely the pen on the desk and used in
conjunction with the ink.

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-5.jpg" %}

The red fountain pen was his Father's, so likely from the 70's or 60's. It's
hard to ID it, but it has a snap closure and is a cartridge/converter. [Mr.
Rene on the Fountain Pen Network][mr_rene_fpn] identifies it as a Parker Jotter
(Fountain Pen variety) and I find his evidence compelling. Maybe it's part of a
matching set with the Jotter ballpoint on his desk - both red.

## Anthony's Stationery

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/anthony-notebook-1.jpg" %}

The key item in Anthony's stationery is his notebook. It's a classic Traveler's
Notebook style notebook [^travelers_notebook] - leather cover that can fit
multiple notebooks inside, secured by rubber bands. His is chock full of notes,
drawings, thoughts and theories. A veritable treasure chest! It's fun to see
Daniel flipping through this notebook throughout the series [^notebooks_rule].

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/anthony-notebook-2.jpg" %}
{%
  include fig.html
  src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/anthony-notebook-3.jpg"
  caption="Notes in the Field!"
%}

We can see Anthony was also a Parker Jotter user, there's one lying about in
his office at the Manor house. And he must have had another pen, based on the
writing in the notebook - either a rollerball or fountain pen. More likely
fountain pen based on the line variation he gets.

## DS Vanloo's Stationery

There's not too much here, he has the P205/PG505 drafting pencil and he uses
that to mark graphite onto a reporter's style flip notebook. A classic
detective setup, I bet the office supply cabinet at every nick is stock full of
these notebooks. I wouldn't trust an English detective using anything else.

So yeah, there was a lot of stationery in the show and it certainly was fun to
do some research into it. I hope this doesn't come off as too negative with
respect to the P205 - I really did enjoy the show and appreciate the level of
effort they put into the stationery props. I hope they continue to adapt the
Rev's other novels into the series and that we can see more 80's stationery!

[^p205]: we should all take a moment to appreciate the photos on the blog.
[^frustrating]: *infuriating
[^reverso]: I think? I'm not as big a watch nerd as I am a stationery nerd. Watch nerds are free to correct me here.
[^book_backlog]: and there's a looong backlog before that happens
[^travelers_notebook]: though not a Traveler's brand one - those didn't exist until the 2000's. But that style existed long before the company
[^notebooks_rule]: tv shows are going to be so boring in the future if they find someone's old iPhone and flick through that for evidence instead of something analog like a notebook. And because everything's in the cloud it probably wouldn't even be feasible to flip through someone's phone 20 years after its use. If it even turns on at all. Notebooks fucking rule
