It's been... a while... since I posted [london trip part 1][ldn1]. I mean to
post a part 2...but I forgot. Seeing as we're returning to the square mile next
month, figured I should wrap up this past trip so I can write about the next
one.

This will be a bit shorter[^1], more of a photo dump than detailed log like
last time. Let's go!

## Tuesday

Tuesday was a day of exploration and shopping. We started the morning in Covent
Garden with breakfast at Arôme cafe, then some stationery shopping at nearby
[Choosing Keeping][ck] and [Present & Correct][pc]. A jaunt down Oxford Street
got us to Selfridge's (with Christmas shop setup in the basement!). Cheeky Pret
lunch eaten in a park, a coffee from the cool [@ConnorDoesCoffee][cdc] at
Storyline, and a romp through Daunt Books in Marylebone. Our most anticipated
dinner of the trip at the [Tamil Crown][tc].

## Wednesday

Wednesday was a bit slower of a day. Cafe breakfast in the morning and a mooch
about Harrod's in the morning (didn't really know what to expect  but it was
certainly not our vibe). Afternoon tea (dinosaur themed!) at our hotel for
lunch was a delight and a _ton_ of food. Some more wanders around Hyde Park and
then we went on a Jack the Ripper tour at nightfall. Honest Burger for dinner
from South Kensington Arcade.

## Thursday

Our Oxford Day! Train from Paddington Station - with a Bakewell Tart before
embarking. Society Cafe for a pick me up once we got there, a mooch about
Waterstones and then checked out the highlights of Oxford - Radcliffe Camera,
Bridge of Sighs, Divinity School, Covered Market. Found a really cool old
cemetary and had a lovely time in the massive Blackwell's book store. On the
train home we went by Wembley Stadium where England was hosting Greece in a
friendly that night (they lost).

## Friday

Our last full day in London, but we made the most of it. Made our way through
Central (to get some Xmas cards from Liberty) on our way to East London.
Wandered through Bethnal Green up to Hackney, where we met Kat's boss for lunch
at [Bambi]. We got some coffee at Climpson and Sons and a nice walk down
Regent's Canal and through Victoria Park. Which conveniently put us at a pub
for a pint outside on a beautiful day. We made our way to Pendley Street
Station for our murder mystery dinner party (wonderful). Final tube ride of the
trip back to the hotel.

## Saturday

We only had a little bit of the morning before heading to Heathrow for our
flight back home. We got breakfast at Ole & Steen for the fanciest sausage roll
of the trip, and back home to Chicago we went.

    then can't help myself and write many many words nonetheless.
