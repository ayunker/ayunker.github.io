title: the summer of go
date: 2022-06-21

I've been feeling the itch to learn something new lately. As usual, I want to
learn all the things at once, and that never ends well. A couple of the things
I've been interested in learning are new programming languages, and more
generally the inner workings of programming languages and their design.

Luckily, I think there's a way for me to cover both of these this summer.

Of all the languages I'm interested in - [Go][golang], [Rust][rust],
[Elm][elm], [Haskell][haskell], [ReasonML][resonml], [OCaml][ocaml]...I think
Go is the one I'll go (hehe) with first.

First off, it's designed to be a simple language. Something you can reasonably
pick up in a few weeks. It also is statically typed and compiled, two things I
haven't had in a while writing Ruby, and I kind of miss those features. All the
tooling and developer experience is supposed to be top-notch.

I plan on following [Learn Go with Tests][learn-go-with-tests], as it looks
like a good introduction that should work well with how I learn. This should
get me a handle on the basics of the language, and get comfortable writing it.

Then, my ultimate goal is work through Thorsten Ball's [Writing an Interpreter
in Go][interpreter-book]. I've been eyeing this book for a while, and I think
it's time to dig in. The book will walk through creating a programming
language, building a fully working interpreter, all in Go. This will be a great
starting point to learning more about the inner workings of programming
language design.

The plan is to work on this a couple of mornings or evenings a week in small
pieces. I have no idea if end of summer is an ambitious or easy or just right
goal, but we'll see how it goes.

And who knows, maybe when I finish this I'll have time to Fall into Rust üçÇü¶û.
