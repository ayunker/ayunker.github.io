*(ed. note: these first reviews might be a little rough. I'm still figuring out how to discuss and write about coffee, but I guess there's no better way to learn than just going for it.)*

Intelligentsia \ Kurimi Ethiopia \ 12oz \ October 23, 2018

**Description**
*(from the bag)* Kurimi takes it's name - and it's inspiration - from an Amharic reference to excellence.
This year's Kurimi delivers the mesmerizing floral aromatics that are it's trademark flavors of honeydew melon, passionfruit, and lemon curd.

**Thoughts**
Very tasty, light and bright.
My first African of the season and I'm happy to be back.
Nice light fruit notes as it goes down.

**Brew Method**
