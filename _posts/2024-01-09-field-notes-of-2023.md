Here's the annual recap of all the [Field Notes][fn] that I've used over the
past year. I prefer using this space to post, and I'm still mostly off
instagram anyways.

I didn't buy any new Field Notes for most of the year...that is, until FN HQ
reopened for the launch party of the [Heartland edition][heartland]. Then the
floodgates opened.

Anywho, here they are in their resplendent glory:

Some random stats:
* Total used: 9
* Favorite of 2023: Kraft with [Hashrocket][hr] sticker
* Average time to fill: 43.75
* Slowest to fill: 49 days (Pitch Black) (hey, that's the same as [last
  year!]({% post_url 2023-01-01-field-notes-of-2022 %}))
* Fastest to fill: 40 days (US of Letterpress)
* Farthest traveling: Pitch Black with [TIL][til] sticker (it went to France!)
