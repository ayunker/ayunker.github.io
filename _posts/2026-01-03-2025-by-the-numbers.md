I don't really know how to do a year-end recap. This year was a lot, in both
the macro and the micro sense. Let's look at some numbers. Numbers are fun.

* [Miles cycled][nazgul]: 328
* Miles run: 287
* [Field Notes Noted][fn]:  10
* Tube Lines Ridden: 0 (😞)
* [TILS] learned: 67
* [Blogs][blogs] [blogged]: 9 & 3
* [Books Read][books]: 26 (with authors from 11 different countries![^1])
* [Bags of Coffee Consumed][coffee]: 20
* Concerts in Graveyards: 1

[^1]: This wasn't planned at first, but I noticed near the beginning of the
    year I was reading a lot of books from Korea and Japan. Then I realized the
majority of the books I read are by American or English authors. Which makes
sense, given that English is the only language in which I am fluent - but!
there are so many great authors and books written in other languages. So I
wanted to challenge myself to explore books more widely. This is getting to be
a long footnote, maybe I'll write a full post about it.
