Baking soda (or bicarbonate of soda, if you're cool), has tons of cleaning
uses! It's become one of my go to cleaning products. Here are some of the ways
I use it:

* **Clean water bottles and bidons** - fill the water bottle with some warm or
hot water, pour in some bicarb and give it a good scrub with a bottle brush.
It'll get rid of light to medium mold or gunk build up, and I find it can pack
a bigger punch than using washing up liquid.

* **Clean stains out of ceramic mugs** - make a thick paste of bicarb and a
little water and give a good scrub. The gentle abrasiveness of the bicarb
really helps get the coffee or tea stains out of mugs. It's kind of a miracle.

* **De-stink the fridge** - just throw a box of bicarb in there, it'll suck up
all the stink.

* **Clear out slow draining sinks** - pour some bicarb down the sink (a funnel
comes in handy here), then pour some Dawn on top of that. Let that work its way
down as you boil up a kettle, and then pour the just off the boil water down
the drain. Really helps clear out gunky buildup in there. Use vinegar instead
of Dawn for some extra fire power (but maybe cover up the drain after you pour
it down though!). 

* **Make a general purpose cleaning paste** - make a mixture of bicarb and Dawn
to use as a general purpose cleaning paste. I've used it in the shower, sinks,
the possibilities are endless! (except maybe don't use it on glass, I think the
abrasiveness of the bicarb might scratch the glass) You can make a big batch of
it in advance, just give it a little stir before you use it.

*(I'll keep adding to this post as I find more uses.)*

As you can see, I'm a big fan of the bicarb. So much so that Kat and my
sister-in-law made me custom bicarb stickers for Christmas last year ðŸ˜„!
