Another year in the books, and more [Field Notes][fn] written in. I've done
this round up the past couple of of years ([2023][fn_recap_2023],
[2022][fn_recap_2022]), and here we go again.

Same as last year, I think I made it through most of the year without buying
any field notes, until the end of the year rolled around. [XOXO
2024][xoxo2024], [XOXO 2019][xoxo2019], [Birds of North America][birds], and
[Vintage][vintage] are newly acquired editions, along with [Charming][charming]
from over the summer.

Here's the Trailhead Edition that made it up Mt. Bierstadt with me (yes the
notebook is out of focus but in my defense it was like 30Â°F up there with a
bitter wind)
