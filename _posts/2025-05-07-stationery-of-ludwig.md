title: the stationery of Ludwig

Kat and I just finished [*Ludwig*][ludwig], and it's one of the best shows
we've watched in the last while. It's got David Mitchell, murder, some laughs,
England (Cambridge!), and stationery. What's not to love?

Seeing as David Mitchell is master puzzle setter Ludwig, I expected he would
use a lot of quality stationery. So being the stationery nerd I am, I did a
deep dive into the stationery we see on screen. Inspired by Mr. Blank First
Page's excellent [video][bfp_bear] on the stationery used in *The Bear*. But
rather than wait for someone else to do the same for *Ludwig*, I decided to do
it myself - except in blog form.

## Home of a Master Puzzle Setter

We only really get to see Ludwig's puzzle cave in the first episode before he
sets off to Cambridge, but it's a wonderful setting to introduce the series.

First we see what I'm going to call the pencil ladder, a great way to keep a
bunch of pencils to hand, so you can always grab a sharp one. I wonder if he
has an organization tactic to know which are sharp and which need sharpening?

but the eraser color is wrong." %}

caption="It could only be a KUM 2-hole sharpener" %}

We can also see him using a fountain pen to solve the crossword in the
newspaper, which exudes a level of confidence I will never have with that
puzzle. It's only a quick view of the fountain pen so I can't tell the brand,
but I would guess Parker, Waterman or Sheaffer - practical and reliable. And
Diamine ink, surely.

Also there's a chalkboard for sketching out puzzles, arranged throughout the
living room. Almost like that of an eccentric mathematician (compliment, of
course). Again, nothing to indicate the type of chalk, but I'm gonna have to
assume it's the fancy [Japanese chalk][chalk] that mathematicians stockpile.
Unless there's some also famous chalk from England or Wales (does chalk come
from slate? I'm getting out of my depth here) that I am unfortunately clueless
to.

## Notebooks

We see a couple of notebooks in the series, but not a whole lot of detail on
them so some guess work is required here.

Ludwig can be seen a few times in the series with a pocket notebook that he
uses for notes or to design/solve some puzzles to calm himself down. It's
impossible to tell the brand - it's pocket size, black leather-y cover, elastic
closure band, grid layout. I like to think it's a [Leuchtturm][] though, seems
fitting.

caption="Designing a crossword, putting the different color inks to good use." %}

There's also James' notebook that's fully encoded and fully wrapped in wrapping
paper. Seems a bit of an odd choice, though I'm known to cover my [notebooks in
stickers][nbowp], and really what's the difference? It's a unique look, and I
could stare at the pages inside for days.

caption="It's all encoded, so who knows what it means. But still, so dope." %}


## Pocket Pens

We spy the pens in Ludwig's pocket in every episode, but it took until the
finale before I could finally scry what these were[^m10]. They kind of looked
like [Pilot G-2s][g2], or [Zebra Sarasas][sarasa] - but neither quite fit the
bill.

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-ludwig/m10-2.png" %}
{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-ludwig/m10-3.png" %}

As you can see, the clip is the color of the ink, but the knock is transparent.
Tough to place. It's not until we get to the finale we see the grip section is
also transparent (to help see the ink level!). It's not a pen I'd seen before.
An English exclusive? 

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-ludwig/m10-4.png"
caption="Finally, a full shot of the pen. Had to wait until the finale for the
denouement." %}

I started researching English ballpoint pens, and landed on [this
site][biro_site], which has a picture of the pen in question, but it doesn't
mention the name. Some reverse image searching and we finally have a name - the
[BIC M10][cult_m10].

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-ludwig/bic-m10-banner.jpg" %}

So the BIC M10 is a made in France BIC ballpoint that is the equivalent of the
BIC Clic over here stateside. It's a bog standard, cheap (less than $1
per), clicky biro sold and used in Europe (and New
Zealand[^brokenwood]), but they just don't exist over here. So it's probably
dead obvious and banal to every Englishman watching the show, but for me it was
exciting and exotic and cool. As such, I've got a 4-pack on the way from
Germany so I can try out these bad boys.

## Conclusion

So what can we tell about the stationery that Ludwig uses? I'd say he's
exacting in the stationery he chooses, and favors practicality over luxury.
Pens and pencils and notebooks he can easily stock up on so when one meets its
end he can easily replace it with the same.

I can't wait for season 2, which will hopefully be filled with more exciting
stationery! And mysteries to solve, too.

    what you're looking for, you see them everywhere!
