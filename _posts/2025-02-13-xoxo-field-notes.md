title: XOXO field notes
date: 2025-02-13

[XOXO][xoxo] was a really neat festival that met at the intersection of art and
tech. It's always been something I've been interested in, but it's slightly
adjacent to my work so I never made it to one in person. But the talks that
came out of there are [incredible][cabel_talk].

Another cool thing about XOXO is [Field Notes][fn_site] always made a special
edition 3-pack to commemorate the festival. If it's something Field Notes is
perennially involved with, you know it's pretty cool.

_An aside:
I'm pretty ardent that I am not a Field Notes **collector**, but a Field Notes
**user**. I don't want my Field Notes to sit on a shelf on display - I intend
to fill every single notebook I own before I die (unless of course I reach an
untimely end[^death])._

_But some editions interest me more than others, and if I see an XOXO edition,
I usually get it. So at the [Field Notes Holiday Market][fnhm], I saw a 3-pack
for the 2019 XOXO Festival and I couldn't resist[^2019_aside]._

---

For a few hours, I thought I had completed the set - every XOXO edition made
(notice I didn't say collection!). It was kinda cool, kinda scary, and what
inspired me to write this post. After a bit [more research][fn_list_site], I
ascertained that I have every edition from 2015 onwards, missing
[2012][xoxo2012] and [2013][xoxo2013] - the first two festivals. Somewhat a
relief, somewhat a let down.

I don't think these editions were ever sold on Field Notes' site, I think they
were only given away as swag to XOXO attendees; and so few were probably
produced I'll probably never own these editions[^2012_aside]. And that's OK!

Anyways, since we're already this far into talking XOXO editions, let's run
through the ones I do have, because they're dope and are worth showing off.

## [XOXO 2014 - Glitch Edition][xoxo2014]

I've eyed these ones for a while, missed out on them when they first came out
(they may not have been for sale at Field Notes at the time). There were
available at last year's Field Notes Holiday Market at their Rarities table,
and I couldn't say no.

## [XOXO 2015 - Brendan Monroe][xoxo2015]

These was the first XOXO edition I picked up. I think a limited number came on
sale on Field Notes' site and I nabbed em. These might be the first
collaboration Field Notes I purchased, it was still early-ish days for me and
Field Notes at that point. The artwork is stunning!

## [XOXO 2016 - Mark Weaver][xoxo2016]

These ones are unreal. The marbling and the colors are super intense. Very
dope, I want to use another one of these soon!

## [XOXO 2018 - Shawna X][xoxo2018]

Very cool and abstract. Reminds me of like jazz and the opening credits on old
_Poirot_ episodes.

## [XOXO 2019 - Maja Dlugolecki][xoxo2019]

These are the ones I just picked up. I think initially the design didn't jump
out at me, but that changed when I saw them in person. The texture of the cover
is really cool too, kinda course like a watercolor canvas.

## [XOXO 2024 - Ellen Wilde][xoxo2024]

It's either these or the 2016 ones as my favorites. The design is stunning and
it's such as a cool concept. Just good stuff.

[^death]: I did nearly get run over by a distracted Mercedes driver whilst on a
    run last weekend, so you never know. 

[^2019_aside]: Somehow I didn't grab these back in 2019 when they were
    available at Field Notes online shop, but I think that was around the time
    I was having concerns with buying more notebooks along with the Colors
    subscription and I couldn't justify purchasing more Field Notes that year.

[^2012_aside]: [oh, but they're gorgeous][little_britain_gorgeous]
