title: summer of go

I've been feeling the itch to learn something new lately. As usual, I want to
learn all the things at once, and that never ends well. A couple of the things
I've been interested in learning are new programming languages, and more
generally the inner workings of programming languages and their design.

Luckily, I think there's a way for me to cover both of these.

Of all the languages I'm interested in - Go, Rust, Elm, Haskell, ReasonML,
OCaml...I think Go is the one I'll go (hehe) with first. 

First off, it's designed to be a simple language. Something you can reasonably
pick up in a few weeks. It also is statically typed and compiled, two things I
haven't had in a while writing Ruby, and I kind of miss those features. All the
tooling and developer experience is supposed to be top-notch.

I plan on following Learn Go with Tests, as it looks like a good introduction
that should work well with how I learn. This should get me a handle on the
basics of the language, and get comfortable writing it.

Then, my ultimate goal is work through /Writing an Interpreter in Go/ by
Thorsten Ball. I've been eyeing this book for a while, and I think it's time to
dig in. The book will walk through creating a programming language, building a
fully working interpreter, all in Go. This will be a great starting point to
learning more about the inner workings of programming language design. 

The plan is to work on this a couple of mornings or evenings a week in small
pieces and see how that goes. I have no idea if end of summer is an ambitious or
conservative or just right goa, but we'll see how it goes.

And who knows, maybe when I finish this I'll have time to Fall into Rust.
