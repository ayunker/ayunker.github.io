-Canon Daniel Clement
</p>

Kat and I just finished the tv series [*Murder Before Evensong*][mb4es], based
on the novel of the same name by the Reverend Richard Coles. And boy, did it
keep this stationery nerd on the edge of his seat. Set in a rural English
village in the 80's, stationery is seen, used, and discussed throughout the
series. It's even a key point in the plot (but I'll try to keep spoilers out of
this review).

I enjoyed writing about the [stationery in *Ludwig*][ludwig] so much, I
couldn't resist doing the same for *Murder Before Evensong*. Let's get into it!

## Daniel's Stationery

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-2.jpg" %}

The Canon is a stationery fan, as we can see from his writing desk throughout
the series. He covers all the bases at his desk, with a fountain pen, Parker
Jotter, and what looks to be a drafting pencil. What more do you need than a
fountain pen, ballpoint and pencil. If only I could keep my setup that
concise...

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-3.jpg" %}

The pencil on the desk looks like it could be a Pentel Graphlet, a PG509 based
on the color of the cap (more on pencils later).

Now the fountain pen and ink are quite interesting. The ink is Registrar's ink,
i.e. a very specific blue-black iron-gall ink. I've known *of* Registrar's ink,
but didn't know anything *about* its history. Registrar's ink - because of its
permanent, waterproof properties - was used for official documents, one of
which being entering births and marriages into a church *registry*. Neat!

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/registrars-ink-2.jpg" %}

According to the show - at least in the 80's - it also wasn't widely available
to anyone (maybe as a means of protection against forgeries?). It was available
to church folk, lawyers and the sort. But it had to be special ordered. The
classic options for Registrar's ink is England's own Diamine
[Registrar's][diamine_registrars] or ESS (Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies)
[Registrar's Ink][ess_registrars]. But looking at the bottle from which Daniel
fills his pen, I would guess he's using [Parker Registrar's
ink][parker_registrars], a potentially odd choice to use the ink of a (then)
US-based company rather than the I'm sure preferred and more affordable local
variety.

There are two fountain pens seen - the black one on the desk and the red one
Daniel uses to write his sermons. From my research into Registrar's ink I
stumbled across the Parker Registrar's pen ([1][ess_registrars] and
[2][parker_registrars_pen]). This is likely the pen on the desk and used in
conjunction with the ink. Iron gall ink can be corosive (I think it's dangers
are overexaggerated, but it can do damage to pens), so best to not use it in
the nice pens.

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/daniel-desk-5.jpg" %}

The red fountain pen was his Father's, so likely from the 70's or 60's. It's
hard to ID it, but it has a snap closure and is a cartridge/converter. [Mr.
Rene on the Fountain Pen Network][mr_rene_fpn] identifies it as a Parker Jotter
(Fountain Pen variety) and I find his evidence compelling. Maybe it's part of a
matching set with the Jotter ballpoint on his desk - both red.

## Anthony's Stationery

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/anthony-notebook-1.jpg" %}

The key item in Anthony's stationery is his notebook. It's a classic Traveler's
Notebook style notebook [^travelers_notebook] - leather cover that can fit
multiple notebooks inside, secured by rubber bands. His is chock full of notes,
drawings, thoughts, theories and conspiracies. A veritable treasure chest. It's
fun to see Daniel flipping through this notebook throughout the series
[^notebooks_rule].

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/anthony-notebook-2.jpg" %}
{%
  include fig.html

  caption="Notes in the Field"
%}

We can see Anthony was also a Parker Jotter user, there's one lying about in
his office at the Manor house. And he must have had another pen, based on the
writing in the notebook - either a rollerball or fountain pen. More likely
fountain pen based on the line variation he gets.

## DS Vanloo's Stationery

There's not too much here, he has a drafting pencil and he uses that to mark
graphite onto a reporter's style flip notebook. A classic detective setup, I
bet the office supply cabinet at every nick is stock full of these notebooks. I
wouldn't trust an English detective using anything else.

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/pencil-1.jpg" %}

While the notebook is probably standard office supply fodder, the pencil is a
bit special and must be a personal preference. Which leads us to the pencil.

### The Pentel P205

I have a nit to pick with this pencil. It gave me a bit of annoyance, but it
led to a lot of research and I learned a few neat things along the way so I
want to talk about it.

When Daniel first meets DS Vanloo, he compliments him on the mechanical pencil
he is using, the Pentel P205. Except...it's not a P205. It is a similar pencil,
but it is not the [P205][] [^p205].

{% include fig.html src="/assets/images/stationery-of-murder-before-evensong/pencil-2.jpg" %}

I love the Pentel P series drafting pencils and own a Pentel P207 myself (I've
had it since college...maybe even high school? It doesn't see as much use these
days, but I wrote many a proof with it back in the day). So I could tell the
pencil wasn't quite right and couldn't help digging (probably too deep) into
it.

While the P205 is historically accurate writing instrument- it was first
manufactured sometime in the 1970's - the shape (especially around the knock
and the grip) just doesn't match up. I have looked up some [vintage
P205s][vintage_p205] from the 70's in case the design changed; but nae, that
design hasn't changed a lick in 50 years.

{%

%}

After a fair bit of research, I'm fairly confident the pencil is a [Pentel
Graph 500][pg505] (PG505), now known as the Pentel Graphlet. It has the black
tip at the end of the knock, the clips look similar, as does the knurling. The
PG505 was released some time in the 80s (having trouble pinning down an exact
year), so it is also historically accurate. I think the money-shot would be if
we could see the lead indicator on the knurling in the series. Alas, it is
never visible. But even without that confirmation, I'm confident in its ID.

Another possibility was the [Alvin Draft/Matic][dm05] (DM05), but the knocks
don't match up as neatly. This was my first guess, but Kat's quick research led
us to the [Graphgear][pg525] (PG525) and subsequently the Graphlet (PG505).

I hope this isn't making too big of a deal about the mismatch - I think it's
awesome that stationery is getting featured in TV shows and getting these
things accurate is hard [^hours]. They could have easily cut the scene and we
would missed out on some stationery goodness.

One final note about drafting pencils - I learned that the *colors* of drafting
pencils (and technical pens) is governed by [ISO 128][iso128]. Yellow for
lead/nib width of 0.35mm, brown for 0.5mm, blue for 0.7, orange for 1.0mm. This
has relaxed a little bit, where say yellow covers 0.35mm and 0.3mm, orange can
also represent 0.9mm lead and black is often used for 0.5mm as well. But that
explains why the P205 is black and the P207 is blue!

It makes sense that they would do this. Back in the day when drafting was done
by hand, you had to swap between different width pen(cil)s frequently, so the
color coding makes it much easier to grab the right one. I just think it's so
cool - I love seeing all these details that existed in a world before
computers. All these well thought out details that make life easier - detail
that's kind of lost now that you can change font weight with a hotkey on your
computer[^watches]. We often talk about making jigs in software development,
little tooling that makes manual process less monotonous or error prone - well,
we didn't come up with that idea.

So yeah, there was a lot of stationery in the show and it certainly was fun to
do some research into it. I hope they continue to adapt the Rev's other novels
into the series and that we can see more 80's stationery.

[^travelers_notebook]: though not a Traveler's brand one - those didn't exist
    until the 2000's. But that style existed long before the company.

[^notebooks_rule]: tv shows are going to be so boring in the future if they
    find someone's old iPhone and flick through that for evidence instead of
something analog like a notebook. And because everything's in the cloud it
probably wouldn't even be feasible to flip through someone's phone 20 years
after its use. If it even turns on at all. Notebooks fucking rule.

[^p205]: we should all take a moment to appreciate the photos on the blog.

[^hours]: I spent *many* happy hours going down the drafting pencil rabbit
    hole.

[^watches]: we see this a lot with watches too - dive watches have the
    rotating bezel for a timer, GMT watches have a second hour hand. They're
cool details now but served real purposes when you didn't have a phone with a
timer and automatically adjust for timezones.
