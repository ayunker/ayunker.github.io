I'm a software engineer from Chicago working at [Hashrocket]. I like coffee,
stationery (especially [Field Notes][field_notes]!), bicycles and our dog
pickle.

## Colophon

This site is built using [jekyll][jekyll], and hosted on Github Pages.

I recently ripped out all the old CSS and started with a clean slate. It's
pretty basic right now, but I imagine I'll be constantly tweaking bits and bobs
as we see this site evolve. All text is typeset with the fantastic [Space
Grotesk][space_grotesk]. There's no javascript or analytics here, mostly
because I don't need a reminder that nobody reads this site. Also mainly
because I respect your privacy.

Feel free to check out the [source][source].

## NAI (aka No AI, get it?)

I guess this needs to be said, because of where things are. But every single
word on this blog is hand typed, with love. No LLMs or anything, for a variety
of reasons. First and foremost, because I like writing and want to practice the
skill so I can (hopefully) get better at it...so hell yeah I'm gonna do this
writing thing with my own two hands.
