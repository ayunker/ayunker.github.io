I'm a software engineer from Chicago working at Hashrocket. I like coffee,
stationery (especially [Field Notes][field_notes]!), bicycles and our dog
Pickle.

## Colophon

This site is built using [jekyll][jekyll], and hosted on Github Pages.

I recently ripped out all the old CSS and started with a clean slate. It's
pretty basic right now, but I imagine I'll be constantly tweaking bits and bobs
as we see this site evolve. All text is typeset with the fantastic [Space
Grotesk][space_grotesk]. There's no javascript or analytics here, mostly
because I don't need a reminder that nobody reads this site. Also because I
respect your privacy.

Feel free to check out the [source][source].
