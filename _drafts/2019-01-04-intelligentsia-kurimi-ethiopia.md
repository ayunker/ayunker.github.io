Intelligentsia \ Kurimi Ethiopia \ 12oz \ October 23 2018

### Description
*(from the bag)* Kurimi takes it's name - and it's inspiration - from an Amharic reference to excellence.
This year's Kurimi delivers the mesmerizing floral aromatics that are it's trademark flavors of honeydew melon, passionfruit, and lemon curd.

### Thoughts
Very tasty, light and bright.
My first African of the season and I'm happy to be back.
Nice light fruit notes as it goes down

### Brew Method
Beehouse ([Stumptown Recipe](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house))
