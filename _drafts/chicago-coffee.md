## The Challenge
I guess it wasn't so much of a challenge. More of a goal. Or objective. Regardless, we moved to Chicago in March of 2017, and my goal for the first year was to buy only coffee roasted in this fine city. Having lived in the suburbs for so long, just a short(ish) drive or train ride from the city, I put off trying a lot of local coffee because I wanted to pick it up from the cafes. Why pay shipping if I can just go and pick it up? Except I didn't go pick it up much, because I was lazy/it was out of the way/a long drive. So now that we were living in the city, I was determined to not make any more excuses. 

Chicago actually has a pretty big coffee scene, thought it feels like it often gets overlooked in the face of Portland, Seattle, New York. Intelligentsia was one of the first big third wave roasters, and is a staple in Chicago - it can be found all over the city. But there are many smaller, local roaster popping up all over the city. 

## The Coffee

I wish I had kept better notes earlier on, so some of this is just based off my (foggy) memory:
