I've admired [Uses This][uses_this] for many many years, and I still get
excited when I see a new post appear in my feed reader. I'll never be featured
there, but this is my site so I can feature myself ðŸ˜€

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm tony. This my blog. I make software, ride bicycles, write in notebooks, nap
with dogs.

## What hardware do you use?

### Computing

* 14" M1 Macbook Pro
* Benq 27" Monitor
* [Keychron Q2][keychron_q2]
* Bose QC35II
* iPhone 11 - it's still kickin'.

### Coffeeing

* [Aeropress][aeropress] - since 2013. 
* [Beehouse][beehouse] - since not long after. The Melitta filters it uses can
  be found in any grocery store.
* Gaggia Classic - since 2023.
* Beans - from local [Chicago roasters][chi_coffee]. It helps that there are
  [so][metric] [many][passionhouse] [great][big_shoulders]
  [roasters][groundswell] here. Ground with a Lagom Mini

### Cycling

* Raleigh Rush Hour - fixed gear. For commuting and fun.
* Canyon Endurace - for longer rides on the lakefront. Gears are nice
  sometimes.

### Stationery

* Trusty [Field Notes][field_notes]
* [Kokuyo Campus notebooks][kokuyo_campus]
* Way too many pens and pencils. I desperately want to have a curated 1-2 pens
  and 1-2 pencils that are my go to, but I've never been successful with that.

## What software do you use?

* macOS - it's unix-y, it's nice. One day I'd like to switch to linux full
  time, but macOS is just so convenient. Great integration with hardware,
  interop between iOS so i can send texts from my laptop, etc.
* [Amethyst][amethyst] - I want my windows to either be full screen, or two
  panes side by side. Amethyst makes it really easy to switch between those two
  options. I use it as a lightweight tiling window manager, and it does so
  admirably.
* [Alacritty][alacritty] - my terminal of choice. Lightweight, fast. No tabs,
  but that's what tmux is for (also session persistence, that's great too).
  Colorscheme is Solarized, code just looks wrong otherwise.
* [Neovim][nvim_dotfiles] - for me, it's the best text editor out there. The
  motions, the plugins, the ecosystem. I love being able to edit text from
  within the terminal.
* [Bear][bear_app] - been using Bear for years. It's small opinionated software
  that really resonates with me. Gorgeous design, fast, simple. All my digital
  notes go in here.
* [1Password][one_password] - to quote the great [Gary
  Bernhardt](https://usesthis.com/interviews/gary.bernhardt/), everyone should
  1Password or something like it.
* [Firefox (Developer's Edition)][ffde] - Chrome, nor it's derivatives (Brave,
  etc.) appeal to me. Firefox is pretty nice, dev tooling is at least on par
  with Chrome, and Multi-Account Containers are clutch for keeping work,
  personal, and other accounts isolated.
* Apple Mail & Fastmail - [Fastmail][fastmail] is rock solid and respects your
  privacy. Apple Mail handles mail. It's a good setup.
